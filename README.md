### Before Run

Before run the project, you must set the environment variable THORVARIUM_BUILD with the path to the build folder of the client. Something like:

    export THORVARIUM_BUILD=/home/dude/thorvarium-js-client/build

### Running

The process is really straight forward, no mysterious ways, just `sbt run` at the folder should do it.

### JS Client

You can see the client that connect with this server here: [thorvarium-js-client](https://github.com/ghophp/thorvarium-js-client)
