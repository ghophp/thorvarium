==============

Multiplayer game server about spaceship. While I use this project to learn more about Scala and the typesafe platform,
I homage @Olifiers (Henrique Olifers), a very talented developer that brought a lot of fun to my childhood.

###TODO
=======

* Server active the turn just when both clients sent the turn_start, this could hang in lag
* When the tab is inactive, the client simulate the game buggy
* Disable ready and clean movements at the running state at client
* Ignore inputs at the running stage
* Fix scroll at chat
* Remove password from JSON
